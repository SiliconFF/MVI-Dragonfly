<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

For some backstory on this project. I have been implementing applications in assembly processes that use IBM MVI Edge to run quality inspection and object detection models. 
The single biggest hurdle that was encountered was the syncronizaiton of the time of trigger and the time of the RTSP frame that was captured. To more clearly layout the issue 
that was encounted please see the chart below:

<img width="751" height="433" alt="rtspjitter" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/634871c1-31af-4742-a2d5-4156c6700218" />  
<br><br/>
This chart shows the jitter of time difference between the rtsp timeline and the realworld timeline which when triggering MVI-Edge will cause there to be a discrepency. While there are tools in the MVI-Edge capture settings 
such as visual trigger and trigger orchestrations these are mostly bandaids for the greater issue.
<br><br/>
This issue gave me the idea to implement an interface to upload photos taken on an edge device (like a raspberrypi) connected to the camera to "Image Folder" devices on the MVI Edge. With this implmentation the compute overhead in the MVI server is reduced and has been tested to vastly improve the time sync from sometimes being off by upwards of 4s to being within ~200ms. The main design goal is to give the integrators of MVI Edge more flexibility with what cameras they can use and to deal with networking and financial restrictions on equipment usage.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Below are the steps needed to deploy and run MVI-Dragonfly with any device

### Prerequisites

This program is built entirely on Python3.9 and it is recommended that you create a virtual environment

  ```sh
  python -m venv [your_virtual_env_name]
  ```
**Then activate the virtual environment:**

  _Windows_
  ```sh
  .\[your_virtual_env_name]\Scripts\activate
  ```
  
  _Linux/RPI_
  ```sh
  source ./[your_virtual_env_name]/bin/activate
  ```



### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SiliconFF/EdgeCamera_MVIUpload.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the new directory
   ```sh
   cd ./EdgeCamera_MVIUpload
   ```
3. Install the required packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure your camera_edge_config.yaml (this file must be named identically and in the same directory as uploader.py)    

  There is a sample yaml available ([sample_camera_edge_config.yaml](https://github.com/SiliconFF/EdgeCamera_MVIUpload/blob/main/sample_camera_edge_config.yaml))
  
  ```yaml
  #MVI Config
  mvi-edge-endpoint: "ExampleDomain:443/api/v1" #MVI Edge Endpoint
  mvi-username: "your_username"
  mvi-password: "your_password"
  mvi-device-uuid: "your_target_MVI_device_UUID" #Device UUID found in MVI Portal
  
  
  #MQTT Config
  mqtt-broker: "BrokerDomain" #Could be the same as MVI edge domain if you are using on board broker
  mqtt-port: 8883 #Use 8883 for TLS, 1883 for non-TLS
  mqtt-tls-required: True
  mqtt-tls-file-name: "yourcertificatefile.crt"
  mqtt-trigger-topic: "Your/Trigger/Topic"
  
  #Camera Config
  camera-type: "USB" #RTSP, USB, or PICAM
  camera-ip: "" #Must Include the rtsp:// prefix for RTSP cameras and the full stream path
  camera-width: "1920" 
  camera-height: "1080"
  
  #General
  host-platform: "WINDOWS" #Valid options are WINDOWS, LINUX, or RPI
  ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once you have completed the prerequuisites and installation steps you simply have to plug in your camera and with your virtual env active run the following in the root directory:

```sh
python .\uploader.py
```

The system will immediately validate your config settings and attempt to connect to your MVI-Edge, MQTT broker, and camera. Operational logs can be found in the automatically generated `uploader.log` in the root directory

**_It is highly recommended to set the script to run on startup which the steps vary depending on your environment_**



### Example Scenario:

RTSP streaming in MVI Edge exhibits poor time synchronization between the photo capture request and the actual frame capture in real time. This issue is particularly problematic for time-sensitive applications, such as processes that wait for inspection completion or involve moving objects.
To address this, consider one of the following alternatives:

Connect the RTSP camera directly to a single-board computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi) or use a different camera interface, such as CSI or USB. (There are plans to add GigE support though this seems overkill for this application)

These options allow connection to your MVI Edge instance with continuous frame capture. The system will wait for a message on a designated MQTT trigger topic of your choice. Upon receiving the message, a frame is captured and uploaded to your specified image folder for inspection.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
- [ ] Verify functionality with RPI CSI modules
- [ ] Allow multiple devices to be set as a target
    - [ ] Devices can be linked to different trigger MQTT topics for more comprehensive coverage   
- [ ] Develop a supervisor webserver for management and config changes
- [ ] Support for reading from GigE cameras
- [ ] Prebuilt RPI install script to automatically configure a raspberry pi to be deployed


See the [open issues](https://github.com/SiliconFF/EdgeCamera_MVIUpload/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
